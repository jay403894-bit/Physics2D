// Named physics tolerances -- every value here used to be a bare literal scattered
// through PhysicsSystem.cpp. World units in this engine ARE pixels (tiles 32-64,
// gravity ~900 px/s^2), so these are pixel quantities; do not "correct" them against
// advice assuming 1 unit = 16px.
//
// Two distinct species live here -- know which one you're touching:
//
//  KINEMATIC TOLERANCES scale with how far things move per fixed substep, or with
//  render geometry. They are gameplay-feel values with physical derivations. Because
//  the engine runs a FIXED accumulator step (the game's PHYSICS_STEP, 1/120s), a
//  "max speed x step" derivation is deterministic -- NOT framerate-dependent, which
//  it would be under a variable dt.
//
//  SENSOR GEOMETRY defines the probe shapes the tile sensors cast. Shared by every
//  directional sensor; change one constant, every sensor agrees.
